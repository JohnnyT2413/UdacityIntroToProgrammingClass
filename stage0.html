<h1>Unit 1: Basics of the Web</h1>

<b>What is the World Wide Web?</b>
<p>Our computers connect to servers via the internet using HTTP
  protocol. Servers host <b><em>HTML documents</em></b>, which comprise the
  web, and after receiving a document request, sends the files back to
  our computers to be displayed on a browser, like Google Chrome.
  <b><em>Hyperlinks</em></b> connect these web pages to
  each other; a prime example of hyperlink usage is on
  <em><a href="wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a></em>.
</p>

<b>HTML-Hypertext Markup Language</b>
<p>There are 30 billion web pages, practically all of them use
  HTML. This is a language made up of text content, markup
  (style of the content), references to documents such as images and videos,
  and links to other pages. Markup is used to take ordinary plain text and
  stylize it, like turning a word <b>bold</b> or into <em>italics</em>.
</p>

<b>Tags</b>
<p>An <b><em>element</em></b> consists of an opening tag, content, and a
  closing tag. If there's no closing tag, everything will be effected by the
  opening tag until it is closed. There are <b><em>void tags</em></b> which do
  not need closing tags, such as image tags. Image tags and links both use HTML
  Attributes, such as "href" and "src", and also values such as "reddit.com" or
  a "url".
</p>

<b>Whitespace</b>
<p>There is often a need to have lines be separate. In Microsoft Word, this
  can be achieved by hitting enter, but when programming in HTML, one must
  use breaks or paragraphs. Breaks are considered an <b><em>inline</em></b>
  element along with images, links, span, and strong. Inline elements
  do not have any boundaries (in a sense). Paragraphs are considered a
  <b><em>block</em></b> element along with div and form. Block elements create
  a box around the affected content.
</p>

<b>HTML Documents</b>
<p>Web pages using HTML use a doctype, which is HTML now that we use HTML5.
  This simplifies the structure we must use.  There is typically a head and
  body to a web page. In the head is where the use of JS or CSS is denoted
  for ease of clarification.
